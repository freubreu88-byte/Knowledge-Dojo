[00:00] Hello everyone and welcome back to
[00:02] another video. In this video, I'm going
[00:04] to be talking about Gemini 3 Pro and my
[00:07] thoughts on the new model. Uh yesterday
[00:09] it got released and yesterday I spent as
[00:12] you can see here 54.6
[00:15] million tokens uh inside of cursor on
[00:18] Gemini 3 Pro. So until you can really
[00:20] give an accurate response on a model and
[00:23] give an opinion about it, you really do
[00:25] need to use it in real world production
[00:27] code settings. So, yesterday I probably
[00:29] used it for 6 hours. And I have to say,
[00:33] um, initial thoughts are I'm very
[00:35] impressed, and I'm going to show you
[00:36] why. In this video, we're going to
[00:37] compare, um, essentially what I did with
[00:40] Gemini 3 Pro yesterday to the previous
[00:43] ViewCreator website. So, over here on
[00:45] the left side of the screen, you can
[00:46] actually see, um, some of the work that
[00:47] I'm going to show you. But, with that
[00:49] being said, I want to show you inside of
[00:51] Cursor what this model costs. You can
[00:53] see Gemini 3 Pro right here. and the
[00:56] pricing compared to some of the other
[00:58] models. So you can see that Gemini 3 Pro
[01:00] inside of cursor the input is $2, cash
[01:02] right $2, cash read 20, then output $12.
[01:07] And then so when you compare that to GBD
[01:10] 5.1, you know, it is a little bit more
[01:12] expensive by maybe like 25% on average.
[01:15] Um, but not terrible. I mean, when you
[01:18] compare it to something like Opus, you
[01:20] know, it's a lot cheaper where Opus is
[01:22] $15 per input and $75 on the output and
[01:24] then Sonnet is $3 on the input and $15
[01:27] on the output. So, it is a more
[01:29] affordable model. It kind of goes in
[01:31] between GBD 5.1 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet
[01:34] or, you know, Claude 4.1 Opus. So, I
[01:36] like that about it. It's kind of that in
[01:38] between on pricing, but in terms of
[01:39] actually how capable of a model it is
[01:41] for vibe coding, that's really what I
[01:43] want to talk about today. So, um, let's
[01:45] pull up cursor and I just want to show
[01:47] you guys what I did yesterday. Uh, we
[01:49] can go to all of these olders. As you
[01:50] guys can see, I was working a ton on all
[01:53] of this related to, uh, actual
[01:56] functionality, right? So, what did I do
[01:58] yesterday? What did I do? What I want to
[02:00] show you is I actually want to show you
[02:01] the complete redesign of the
[02:04] viewcreator.ai website that Gemini 3 Pro
[02:07] did. Now, this is not pushed yet to
[02:09] production. So, here I'm on
[02:10] viewcreator.ai and then over here I'm on
[02:12] my local host. So, we have not yet
[02:14] pushed this code, but we're actually
[02:16] going to compare what Gemini 3 Pro did.
[02:18] And if you guys watched my stream
[02:19] yesterday, you know, I was streaming for
[02:20] about a little bit over three hours
[02:22] using the model doing this, but you
[02:23] know, we spent 54 million tokens. What
[02:26] did that actually get us, right? So, you
[02:28] know, let's take a look. So, you can see
[02:30] here that, you know, I just had this
[02:32] slider and then the website was like
[02:34] very very plain with like here, I'll
[02:36] move my my face came out, but you know,
[02:38] you can see that, you know, just very
[02:40] plain um typical. It kind of looks AI.
[02:44] Um, you know, I'm not super impressed.
[02:45] There's like problems here with this
[02:47] section. This section works with every
[02:49] platform is like this looks terrible.
[02:51] Um, just not super impressive website,
[02:53] right? So, super textheavy from the
[02:56] blog. This doesn't even, you know, load
[02:57] anything in. So, this here not doesn't
[03:00] fit with the theme. So, you know, lots
[03:02] of issues that we had with the previous
[03:04] site. And what I did on stream yesterday
[03:05] is I pretty much went over to Gemini and
[03:07] I said, "Hey, I want you to completely
[03:08] reinvision this." Right? And what it did
[03:11] is it created this site that you're
[03:13] seeing on the left. So it says your
[03:15] command center for social media growth
[03:17] and it created a really cool and I
[03:19] actually want to expand this. It created
[03:20] like a really cool demo and interactable
[03:22] demo. So you can see here that like this
[03:24] would give a user kind of a view of what
[03:27] the view creator dashboard looks like.
[03:28] Right? So I like what it did here. It's
[03:30] kind of unique. You know it doesn't look
[03:32] AIdriven. It did these animations in the
[03:34] background um for like the different
[03:36] social accounts. Also, the navbar is
[03:39] super impressive now. So, the navbar,
[03:41] you can see that I updated the navbar to
[03:43] have features, platforms, pricing, and
[03:45] then resources. So, you compare that to
[03:47] this navbar, and it's like, okay, like
[03:49] that did a pretty good job with um with
[03:52] that. I'm very impressed. And then even
[03:53] if we shrink it down and take a look,
[03:55] what does it look like on mobile menus?
[03:56] Look at the mobile menu. The mobile menu
[03:58] looks fantastic. So, in terms of UI, I
[04:02] was incredibly impressed by the Gemini 3
[04:05] Pro model. Uh, I think that the UI in my
[04:08] opinion, you know, these Sonnet models
[04:10] or the Opus models have been uh known
[04:13] for good UI, but I would say that Gemini
[04:15] 3 Pro actually beats out claude uh for
[04:18] UI now. So, you can look at this. So,
[04:20] this is like kind of that all major
[04:22] platforms and look at this. It it did
[04:23] perfect hover effects and it actually
[04:25] then created all of these pages. So,
[04:27] this page here, this one was created by
[04:29] Gemini, the entire thing, right? And it
[04:31] was just through one prompt. I just
[04:33] said, "Hey, you know, go create the
[04:34] entire page and look at all this." You
[04:36] know, it's it uh it really did a good
[04:38] job creating like very good
[04:41] componentdriven
[04:43] rather than text driven sections and I
[04:45] really liked that. And and this was
[04:47] pretty much all a oneshot. So that was a
[04:49] oneshot there. Let's go back to the
[04:50] homepage. And it did that with all of
[04:52] these pages. It created the skyrocket
[04:53] your Instagram engagement. And it did a
[04:56] great job on even like the title tags,
[04:58] Instagram management and automation with
[05:00] view creator you know like all these
[05:01] things that are you know small things
[05:03] that you notice where you say okay this
[05:05] is actually a very very capable model
[05:08] you know so stop the chaos start the
[05:10] flow and this is just UI and I'm going
[05:11] to get into the you know backend
[05:12] functionality and what I think on that
[05:14] as well but here's you know this section
[05:16] this section here's the publishing and
[05:18] the content calendar I mean look what it
[05:20] did I mean I didn't give it any you know
[05:22] I did not give it any specific prompt on
[05:25] like create this section. It was able to
[05:26] intuitively do this. So, I've been, you
[05:28] know, very impressed in terms of its
[05:30] creativity. Good animations here. Um,
[05:33] the reviewer section looks a lot better.
[05:36] Frequently asked questions looks good.
[05:37] And then this looks a lot more on theme.
[05:39] Maybe the buttons need to be changed.
[05:41] But all in all, very impressed by what
[05:43] it did. Also, I made updates to the
[05:45] pricing page. So, this is the updated
[05:47] pricing page from uh from Gemini. So,
[05:50] you can see the responsiveness there is
[05:52] pretty good. And if we compare that to
[05:54] the pricing page over here, you know,
[05:56] very very good. I would say I think
[05:58] that's a substantial improvement from
[06:00] what we had before. So in terms of UI, I
[06:03] think that there is actually a new
[06:04] leader in terms of which model is the
[06:07] best and most capable in terms of AI or
[06:09] or UI. And I think that it's now this
[06:12] Gemini 3 Pro model because in order to
[06:14] oneshot all of this, you know, that's
[06:17] guys, that's pretty impressive. I mean,
[06:19] you're talking about oneshotting
[06:22] completely unique components that don't
[06:24] look like they were created with AI. I'm
[06:27] just very impressed. Um, I love what it
[06:28] did with the navbar. So, from a UI
[06:30] standpoint, I would say probably I would
[06:32] give it a 10 out of 10. Um, to be
[06:34] completely honest with you, I think it's
[06:35] very good. Now, let's actually go to the
[06:38] view creator dashboard and we're going
[06:39] to talk about some of the backend
[06:40] functionality that it built rather than
[06:42] the UI. And in order to do that, I'm
[06:44] actually going to once again kind of
[06:46] shrink this browser so we can compare
[06:47] and I can show you guys what this
[06:49] actually created. So, let me log into my
[06:51] View Creator account over here on my
[06:53] other monitor. And what I'm going to do
[06:55] is I'm actually going to show you guys
[06:56] the features that it was able to create.
[06:58] So, let's go over to Oh, actually, so I
[07:01] did push this. So, actually, we can just
[07:02] use one. So, I did push this code and it
[07:05] is fully working in production. So,
[07:07] first of all, I can't compare what it
[07:08] looked like before because I already
[07:09] pushed it and it's already fully
[07:11] functional. But if I go over to YouTube
[07:13] and I go to manage videos, I want to
[07:16] show you some really unique
[07:18] functionality that uh Gemini was able to
[07:21] build pretty much in one shot. You guys
[07:22] can watch the stream from yesterday as I
[07:24] was building this on stream. But a
[07:26] couple things, let's actually go to a
[07:28] different video so I can show you. Uh
[07:30] let's do this one. So this vibe coding,
[07:32] no talking stream, right? So this stream
[07:34] has no tags. It has just a standardized
[07:38] thumbnail. Um it's it's you know you can
[07:40] see so we changed this but the backend
[07:42] functionality that we actually built is
[07:45] we made it so that users can click
[07:46] enhance with AI and we can just say we
[07:50] can give it a prompt. This is optional.
[07:52] So if I just want to improve it I can
[07:54] just click generate and it's actually
[07:55] going to be able to improve the
[07:57] description that was already there or I
[07:58] can pass in instructions. So let's just
[08:00] try generate here and it says
[08:01] description generated successfully and
[08:03] then it completely rewrote the
[08:04] description. Right? So, it added
[08:06] hashtags. It added um just a little bit
[08:09] more text and content about, you know,
[08:11] what the video was about. And I can do
[08:13] the same thing with tags. So, if I click
[08:15] suggest tags, the same thing is going to
[08:17] happen in seconds. It literally is able
[08:20] to render in all the tags associated
[08:23] with what with what this video is and
[08:25] it's able to take in the context of this
[08:26] video. And I think we got this in one
[08:28] shot with Gemini 3 Pro yesterday. So,
[08:30] the ability to be able to do this is
[08:32] incredible. I can do the same thing with
[08:34] the title. Now, you know, with the title
[08:36] here, um you know, this title, we don't
[08:38] really want to change the title. Vibe
[08:40] coding notes talking session number six,
[08:42] you know, um we don't want to actually
[08:44] change that, but really really impressed
[08:47] with um with with what with what Gemini
[08:50] 3 Pro was able to do. I mean, it was
[08:51] able to oneshot all these features. Um
[08:54] it was able to do from database updates
[08:57] to backend API updates to amazing job on
[09:00] the front end. I think that's probably
[09:02] um this is going to be my go-to model
[09:04] for the front-end UI and you know I just
[09:07] am very very impressed with what it was
[09:09] able to do and you know I think it will
[09:12] take some time to get used to this new
[09:14] model as you know with all these models
[09:16] it does take time to say okay where is
[09:18] this going to fit in my workflow but
[09:20] just after using you know 54 million
[09:22] tokens on it and to see what it was able
[09:24] to build and the updates that it was
[09:26] able to make to the home website I have
[09:28] to say that I am very very impressed. I
[09:31] mean, you guys can let me know what you
[09:32] think in the comment section down below,
[09:34] but in terms of what it was able to do
[09:36] in the front-end UI, I would say that
[09:38] this is probably the best model now for
[09:40] front-end development for the user
[09:42] interface. And then in terms of um the
[09:45] back end, I think that it is it does
[09:47] have that oneshot capability. And also
[09:49] one thing that I want to touch on is
[09:52] when you're talking about speed, right?
[09:54] If we if we take speed into the
[09:56] equation, which is huge. Obviously, you
[09:58] know, something that's going to be more
[09:59] prevalent and important in 2026 as a
[10:01] vibe coder is how fast are these models,
[10:04] right? How fast are they? And I think
[10:06] one thing that I've already found is
[10:09] that, you know, Gemini 3 Pro, if you
[10:12] were to put it in between,
[10:15] you know, if you were to compare GBT 5.1
[10:19] with Claude with Gemini, I would say
[10:22] that in terms of speed,
[10:25] Gemini is going to fall in the middle,
[10:26] right? GBT 5.1 is very slow. And you
[10:30] know, that's actually causing me to
[10:32] change my mind a little bit on the GPT
[10:34] family just because yes, you know, I
[10:36] have a task, I give it to GBT, and it
[10:38] does have the ability to think fast or
[10:39] slow now. That's kind of like their big
[10:41] pitch with the GPD 5.1 update. But what
[10:43] I found is that on average, the latency
[10:46] on that model is significant. Whereas
[10:48] Gemini 3 obviously are also has that
[10:51] capability to think fast or slow based
[10:53] off of uh the prompt that it's been
[10:55] given. But on average, based off of my
[10:58] work yesterday, I found that the Gemini
[11:00] 3 Pro model was faster than GPT uh 5.1,
[11:04] but slower than Claude 4.5 Sonnet. Okay.
[11:08] So, it kind of falls in the middle. So,
[11:09] I think that this is like an
[11:10] inthe-middle model, which is nice. Um,
[11:13] you know, cuz it's just another tool
[11:15] that's now added to our toolbox, right?
[11:17] Like, if you I think that there's always
[11:18] going to be a different place for
[11:21] different models in your workflow. And
[11:23] one thing to just remind you guys is
[11:25] that hey GBT or not GBT but Gemini 2.5
[11:28] Pro was essentially unusable at at this
[11:32] point. You know it it was released in
[11:34] March of 2025. It was old. Uh it did not
[11:38] do very well on benchmarks with coding
[11:40] and you know even like models like GLM
[11:42] 4.6 were beating Gemini 2.5 Pro. So, you
[11:45] know, now that we have this better
[11:46] model, you know, I do think that you
[11:49] should start figuring out how to
[11:51] integrate it into your workflow because
[11:53] there's a place for each of these models
[11:55] in your workflow. So, I highly recommend
[11:59] trying this model out and seeing where
[12:01] it fits in your workflow. But for me,
[12:03] after four 54 million tokens, you are
[12:05] definitely going to see me start to use
[12:07] this model more on stream, especially
[12:09] for UI, um, especially for back-end
[12:12] development. And I think that it does a
[12:13] good job across the board, but with UI,
[12:16] it just did an incredible job for me.
[12:17] So, with that being said, I'm going to
[12:19] wrap up the video, but definitely a Bird
[12:20] Mind approved model. Let me know what
[12:22] you guys think in the description down
[12:23] below, and uh I will see you guys in the
[12:26] next video. Bye.
