[00:00] In this video, I'm going to give you a
[00:01] complete beginner guide on claw skills.
[00:03] And specifically, I'm going to talk
[00:04] about why we should use claw skills.
[00:05] What are the three reasons why we should
[00:07] use it right now? And also, I'm going to
[00:08] talk about how claw skills work behind
[00:10] the scene. How does it work with sub
[00:12] agents, MCB servers, and also the
[00:14] overall agent workflow? And lastly, I'm
[00:16] going to show you my top four cloud
[00:17] skills that actually 10x my productivity
[00:19] when I use Claude every single day. So,
[00:21] by the end of this video, you will
[00:22] become a Claw skill master. not only
[00:24] know why to use it and when to use it,
[00:26] but also know how you can use it to 10x
[00:28] your productivity with Claude. So, with
[00:30] that being said, if you're interested,
[00:31] let's get into it. All right, so before
[00:32] we jump in, a quick intro for those who
[00:34] are new here. My name is Eric and I have
[00:36] spent years as a senior software
[00:38] engineer at companies like Amazon, AWS,
[00:41] and Microsoft. And I have started this
[00:43] YouTube channel to share everything I
[00:45] have learned along the way from AI and
[00:47] coding to automations, web 3, career
[00:50] developments, and more. all broken down
[00:53] into practical tutorials that you can
[00:55] actually follow. So if you're ready to
[00:57] level up, make sure to check out my
[00:58] YouTube channel and hit that subscribe
[01:00] button. Now let's get back to the video.
[01:02] All right, so now what I want to tell us
[01:04] is what's the reason why we should use
[01:05] claw skill. And the first reason why we
[01:07] should use it is because it's really
[01:08] good at doing specific and repeatable
[01:10] task. Let's say we have claw skill here.
[01:12] Help us to design a nice front end.
[01:13] Right? The first time the process is
[01:15] going to be very painful because you
[01:16] have to tell Claude exactly what kind of
[01:18] style, what kind of color, what kind of
[01:20] typography it's going to use to create a
[01:22] nice perfect front end that you imagine,
[01:24] right? And after that process is done,
[01:26] you can be able to have claw here to
[01:27] create a cloud skill so that you can be
[01:29] able to reuse it. So the next time when
[01:31] you give it a prompt saying that help me
[01:32] to design a nice front end, then claw
[01:34] will know exactly what kind of style,
[01:36] what kind of typographies, what kind of
[01:37] UI design is count as nice front end. So
[01:40] the process here is much more smooth and
[01:42] the AI here won't hallucinate so much
[01:44] because claw skills will tell AI exactly
[01:46] how to create those things. And the
[01:47] second reason why we should use claw
[01:49] skill is that it also help you to save
[01:50] context because before when we don't
[01:52] have claw skills we will have to use
[01:54] claw rules which is kind of like a
[01:55] system prompts that we pass to claude
[01:57] every time we talk to cla right but the
[01:59] problem with claw rules is that every
[02:00] time when you talk to claude you had to
[02:02] pass all the claw rules or all the
[02:04] system prompts to claw agent here to
[02:06] basically give you the response. But the
[02:07] thing is that not all the rules are
[02:09] relevant to what you're asking for. And
[02:10] that's why claw skill is really
[02:12] different is because now cloud will
[02:14] automatically pick the right skill to
[02:16] the request that you're asking for.
[02:17] Right? So let's say you're trying to
[02:18] design a nice front end. Then basically
[02:20] cloud will find the right skills or
[02:22] maybe like a front-end skill or maybe
[02:23] like a UX UI skill that will basically
[02:26] help you to complete the task that's
[02:27] relevant to what you're asking for.
[02:29] Okay. So that will help you to save so
[02:31] much context during the process of using
[02:33] claude. And the last reason why we
[02:34] should use claw skill is that it's also
[02:36] really easy to share, right? You can
[02:37] think of claw skill as like a SOP where
[02:40] basically creates a SOP to guide the AI
[02:42] on how to exactly do things, right? And
[02:44] what you can do is that you can
[02:45] basically have this cloud skill to
[02:47] export in a zip file so that you can
[02:49] share with other people, right? Share
[02:51] this with other employers or co-workers.
[02:53] And what you can do is that you can also
[02:55] create multiple sub aents and each sub
[02:57] aents here can have a shared same clause
[03:00] skills that's being created earlier that
[03:02] you have in your projects. So it's much
[03:04] more easier for you to share, right? And
[03:05] also much more easier to save context
[03:07] and also help you automate a specific
[03:09] and reusable task. So those are the
[03:11] three main reasons why we should use
[03:13] claw skills to basically improve our
[03:14] productivity for every time we're using
[03:16] claw. All right, so now you know why we
[03:18] should use claw skills. So now let's
[03:20] take a look at how it works behind the
[03:21] scene. So right here you can see that we
[03:23] have our agent configurations right this
[03:24] is going to be our clawed agents and
[03:26] basically inside of our configurations
[03:28] we have three main parts one is our core
[03:30] system prompts right like what I
[03:32] mentioned before like our claw rules uh
[03:34] static system prompts that will be sent
[03:36] to every conversation that we're going
[03:37] to have with claude and then we also
[03:39] have our equipped skills so these are
[03:41] skills that we can add later on for
[03:42] example we can add a skill particularly
[03:44] that can handle PDF that can handle
[03:46] excel sheets that can handle like PBTX
[03:49] or like powerpoints right so this is our
[03:51] equipped skills for our clot and we also
[03:54] have our equipped MCP servers. So MCP
[03:56] servers if you don't know what it is you
[03:58] can check out this video right here
[03:59] which I'm exactly how MCP server work
[04:02] but basically you can think of MCP like
[04:04] a tools a list of tools that AI agent
[04:06] here can call for example it can be able
[04:08] to you know search data on the web it
[04:10] can be able to call like API to fetch
[04:13] data from like your database or like
[04:14] GitHub create a pull request on your
[04:16] behalf so those are MTB servers right so
[04:19] these are the three main key components
[04:20] of our agent configurations and what
[04:22] happens here is that for every agent
[04:24] here it has a agent virtual machine and
[04:26] this virtual machine here has access to
[04:28] like bash commands, have access to
[04:30] Python, Node.js, any type of language,
[04:32] right? And then we also have our file
[04:34] system and what this file system does
[04:35] here is that basically contains the list
[04:37] of contents for the skill directory. So
[04:39] all the skills that you create that you
[04:40] add will be live in here inside of this
[04:43] file system and each skill here we have
[04:45] the skill.md file which basically the
[04:47] description of what the skill look like,
[04:48] right? And then we also could have like
[04:50] data sources. We also could have like
[04:52] Python scripts. So after the skill is
[04:54] being triggered by claude, it will
[04:55] basically execute a script to basically
[04:57] get informations that we need to guide
[04:59] the AI on the right track. So in this
[05:00] case to put it in practice here, you can
[05:02] see that we have a situation where a
[05:03] user ask you to fill this PDF form based
[05:06] on what you know about me and here is
[05:07] the location on where the file is. So
[05:10] claw will basically think about it and
[05:11] try to see okay what kind of skill we're
[05:13] going to use right so you can see that
[05:14] it's going to be a PDF. So it's going to
[05:16] use the PDF skill claw automatically
[05:18] identify what skill related to our query
[05:20] be able to call the right skills and
[05:21] call the right tools to basically
[05:23] complete the user request. All right. So
[05:24] now you know how it works and why we
[05:26] should use it. Let me show you four claw
[05:28] skills that will boost your productivity
[05:30] whenever you're using claude. But before
[05:32] I show you the first claw code skill
[05:33] that I personally use, one thing to note
[05:35] here is that you can see I opened a
[05:36] projects called bookkeeping
[05:37] applications. In this project, I
[05:39] basically built this using Nets.js. And
[05:41] you can check out the full tutorial on
[05:42] how did I build this applications using
[05:44] this five MCB servers that I show you in
[05:46] this video right here. But moreover,
[05:48] basically what this application does is
[05:50] that it's a bookkeeping application that
[05:51] keep track of your receipts, your bank
[05:53] statements and later you can be able to
[05:55] use that to prepare your tax and file
[05:56] it. Right? So right here you can see
[05:58] this is a landing page. We have all the
[05:59] features here and here we can also be
[06:01] able to log in to our application. This
[06:02] is our dashboard. We can also match our
[06:04] transactions and also this is where we
[06:06] upload our bank statements and also this
[06:08] is where we upload our receipts and keep
[06:10] track of them inside of our tables. So
[06:12] what I want to do now is basically try
[06:13] to introduce you the first clause skill
[06:14] that I use which is the front end design
[06:16] skill from claw code. And what it can do
[06:18] is that it will basically create a
[06:19] production grade front end interface
[06:21] with high quality design. So based on
[06:23] what your application does, it will
[06:24] first try to understand the applications
[06:26] and then it try to create a design
[06:28] that's best fit for your application.
[06:29] And just to keep in mind that this is
[06:31] what it looks like right now for our
[06:32] applications. And if I were to navigate
[06:34] to our landing page, this is what it
[06:35] looks like right now. So what I'm going
[06:36] to do here is I'm going to follow this
[06:38] guide right here to basically install
[06:39] the marketplace from our Claw Code. And
[06:41] then I'm going to install this plugin
[06:43] right here, which is the front end
[06:44] design. And I'm just going to tell Clo
[06:46] here to redesign our entire front end.
[06:47] So in this case, let's take a look at
[06:49] how it works. So right here, I'm just
[06:50] going to copy this command right here.
[06:52] Navigate back to my CLCO session. And
[06:54] I'm just going to run this. basically
[06:56] try to install the claw code plugins
[06:58] inside of our marketplace. Because I
[07:00] already have this installed, I'm just
[07:01] going to use the slash plugin right now.
[07:03] So, if I were to do the slash plugin,
[07:05] right? And here you can see I have my
[07:07] marketplace right here, which you can
[07:09] see that we have claw code plugins
[07:10] installed. So, now we're going to do now
[07:12] is try to install the front-end design
[07:14] skill. So, right here, I'm just going to
[07:16] copy this command. But because I already
[07:18] have this installed on my local machine,
[07:19] if I were navigate to installed, you can
[07:21] see that I have this one installed. But
[07:22] for yourself, you're probably just going
[07:23] to run this again inside of your clock
[07:25] session. So what we're going to do now
[07:27] is basically try to instruct clco here
[07:29] to, you know, use the front end design
[07:31] skill to redesign our application. And
[07:33] because I already have done so here you
[07:35] can see that after I have using the
[07:37] clock session here instructed, clo uses
[07:40] the front-end design skill basically
[07:41] redesign the entire application for this
[07:44] u front end. And you can see this what
[07:46] it looks like. So right here you can see
[07:47] it gives me a complete redesign of our
[07:50] landing page and it used to be using the
[07:52] blue now it's using the green. Okay. So
[07:54] right here you can see we have the you
[07:56] know on boarding sessions the entire
[07:57] typography is changed the testimonials
[08:00] right you can see the call to actions as
[08:02] well as the footer are completely
[08:04] changed. So now if I were to log in to
[08:06] the applications and if I were to sign
[08:08] in here you can see this what the
[08:09] dashboard look like. So right here you
[08:10] can see it still looks like what it used
[08:12] to be but it's just that the entire
[08:14] theme typographies the styles are all
[08:16] changed right and you can see that the
[08:18] matchings here are still exist. So
[08:21] pretty much you can see that the style
[08:22] here are consistent throughout the
[08:24] entire application which is really cool.
[08:26] So in this case that's pretty much how
[08:27] we can use the front-end design skills
[08:29] in clock code to basically give yourself
[08:31] or give your application a complete
[08:33] redesign that's make it much more like a
[08:35] production ready. And I'll make sure to
[08:36] leave the link for this post in the
[08:37] description below so that you can check
[08:38] it out. So the next skill that I want to
[08:40] show you here is the domain name
[08:41] brainstormer which will basically help
[08:43] you to find a domain name for your
[08:44] project. So let's say if you have
[08:45] building like bunch of projects and
[08:47] you're struggle to find the right domain
[08:49] name that's available that's the best
[08:50] fit for your projects then this claw
[08:52] skill here will help you to do so. And
[08:53] here you can see that what this claw
[08:55] skill does is that basically you provide
[08:56] a instruction saying that help me to
[08:58] find a domain name for this program
[08:59] projects. And what it does here is that
[09:01] it's going to look through all the
[09:02] domain names online and try to find what
[09:05] are the domain names that are available
[09:06] and what are the domain names that's
[09:07] best fit for our target audience and
[09:09] also what are the key features that this
[09:11] domain name has right and all in all it
[09:13] will basically gather try to find the
[09:15] right domain name and it'll help you to
[09:16] rank it to figure out what's the best
[09:18] pick for the domain name for this
[09:19] current projects. For example, this
[09:21] project is good for developer short and
[09:23] memorable and also has the.dev dev
[09:25] extensions which adds credibility and
[09:27] most importantly this domain name is
[09:29] available right now right so what we can
[09:31] do here is that I'm just going to
[09:32] download this folder right here which
[09:34] you can see is called the domain name
[09:35] brainstormer which only has the skilld
[09:38] file and once I download this I
[09:39] basically add it onto our projects so
[09:41] here you can seeclaw folder there I
[09:43] create a folder called skills and inside
[09:45] this folder I create a folder called
[09:46] domain name brainstormer which basically
[09:48] I just drag that folder entirely into
[09:50] this skill folder and I basically
[09:52] restart my claw session and now what I
[09:54] can do is that based on this project
[09:56] that I have right now, can you use the
[09:58] domain name brainstormer skill to
[10:00] basically help me to brainstorm the
[10:01] right domain name for this project? So
[10:04] that's going to be my prompt and I'm
[10:05] just going to send this request and
[10:07] right away you can see that claw here
[10:08] triggers a domain name brainstormer here
[10:10] to basically trigger the skill and
[10:11] basically chatter generates the relevant
[10:13] domain suggestions. So in this case
[10:15] while we wait let's give a quick shout
[10:16] out to the sponsor of this video. Think
[10:18] if you're in AI or tech your work is
[10:20] [music] probably scattered everywhere.
[10:23] GitHub, papers, LinkedIn X, maybe
[10:26] YouTube. That's exactly why I started
[10:28] using Dink. What Dink is, Dink.Me is an
[10:32] AI native digital identity platform
[10:34] [music] built for developers,
[10:36] researchers, and AI talent. It
[10:38] automatically pulls your real
[10:39] achievements from GitHub, Google
[10:42] Scholar, LinkedIn X, Archive, and more,
[10:45] [music] and turns them into a living,
[10:47] autoupdating AI identity card. This is
[10:49] my Dink profile.
[10:52] Instead of a static resume, everything
[10:54] here updates automatically. [music]
[10:56] New repo, paper, project, or roll, it
[10:59] shows up without me touching anything.
[11:01] What's powerful is that Dink [music]
[11:03] doesn't just list links. It understands
[11:05] your work. You can see verified
[11:07] contributions, real collaboration
[11:09] networks through the achievement [music]
[11:10] graph, and how people are actually
[11:13] connected through projects, not cloud.
[11:15] You can browse other members Think
[11:17] [music] pages, analyze their profiles,
[11:19] and discover like-minded people.
[11:21] Want to collaborate, hire, or build a
[11:23] team? You can DM directly and start real
[11:26] conversations based on actual work. Dink
[11:30] feels like what LinkedIn should have
[11:31] become for the AI era. A deeper, more
[11:34] credible identity that actually
[11:36] understands what you do. Dink is
[11:38] currently [music] invite only. So, if
[11:40] you want to try it, use my invite code
[11:42] below and create your AI native identity
[11:44] here. Links also in the description.
[11:48] All right. So, back to the video now.
[11:49] Here you can see that as a result this
[11:51] is what the AI generates after cloud
[11:53] skills has generated using the domain
[11:55] searcher. Here you can see that we have
[11:56] our premium AI domains right here which
[11:58] are all available right and they're all
[12:00] in with.AI AI extension. There's also
[12:02] the strong.com options, the io or the
[12:05] tech forward options and here is the top
[12:08] tech recommendations and they're all
[12:10] available in this link right here which
[12:12] shows in real time results and you can
[12:13] see that it also concludes the finding
[12:15] of the budget forai and this is the
[12:17] minimum two year of registrations.
[12:19] Pretty much what we can do here from now
[12:21] is just pick the domains that we want
[12:22] and just go with it. Right? So pretty
[12:24] much that's how we can use the domain
[12:25] finder skill to find the right domain
[12:27] for our projects. Okay. So the next
[12:29] skill that we're going to show you here
[12:30] is the Stripe scale. This is really
[12:32] important because if you're going to
[12:33] have accepting payment for your
[12:34] applications and it's really important
[12:35] to keep it consistent for how you're
[12:37] going to integrate your Stripe payments
[12:38] into your application. So right here you
[12:40] can see I have navigated to a very
[12:42] special skill called Stripe skill or
[12:44] Stripe integration skill. Basically it's
[12:46] going to master the Stripe payment
[12:47] processing. We can actually be able to
[12:49] create a skill and have our AI here have
[12:51] clogg here to implement the stripe
[12:53] payment consistently. Okay. So, for
[12:55] example, creating a checkout session,
[12:56] right? Creating a one-time payment or
[12:59] creating a custom payment flow. You can
[13:01] see that this documentation or this
[13:02] cloud skill here has already create this
[13:04] thing automatically, right? So, all we
[13:06] had to do here just tell it to implement
[13:08] this inside of our applications and
[13:09] should be able to implement in the right
[13:11] way. So, in our case, basically, we're
[13:12] just going to navigate to the Stripe
[13:13] integration here. You can see that we
[13:15] only have one file in this folder, which
[13:17] is the skill MD file. And I'm just going
[13:19] to download this folder right here.
[13:20] Navigate back to claw code. In this
[13:22] case, I'm just going to drag the skill
[13:24] into this skill folder. And right here,
[13:26] I'm just going to restart my claw
[13:28] section. And here I'm just going to say
[13:29] based on the application right now,
[13:30] please use the Stripe integration skill
[13:32] to integrate our Stripe payment inside
[13:34] of our application. Okay. So then here
[13:36] is our prompt. So I'm just going to
[13:37] switch to plan mode and basically have
[13:39] Clocko here to use the Stripe
[13:41] integration skill to build our Stripe
[13:43] integration. And then here I'm just
[13:44] going to run this. All right. So right
[13:46] now we can see it's first going to
[13:47] analyze the application here and try to
[13:49] explore the clear understanding of the
[13:51] application. Here is the summary. So
[13:52] here you can see that we did not
[13:54] implement the payment processing. We did
[13:55] not implement the subscription
[13:56] management. And here you can see that
[13:58] there's the recommended uh payment
[14:00] structure. So right here based on the
[14:01] existing pricing page, here is what it
[14:03] recommends. So we have our starter plan
[14:05] which is no payment required. There's
[14:06] the growth plan which is most popular
[14:08] and it has the 14-day free trial.
[14:10] There's also the pro plan which is the
[14:12] $39 per month and it also includes the
[14:15] 14 days free trial. So here you can see
[14:17] what it does here is that it's going to
[14:18] analyze the application, create a plan,
[14:20] and before it do so, it's going to ask
[14:21] me some serious questions to clarify the
[14:24] intent. So it says that you want to
[14:26] offer a 14 days free trial for the
[14:28] growth and the pro plan. Here I'm just
[14:29] going to say yes for the 7 days free
[14:31] trial instead. And here's asking us if
[14:33] you have the Stripe API keys. I'm just
[14:35] going to say yes, I do. And then here,
[14:37] what are the plan changes? Should be
[14:38] able to upgrade or downgrade? And yes,
[14:40] I'm just going to say allow that. And
[14:42] basically, you can see these are the
[14:43] answers that I have. I'm just going to
[14:44] submit the answer here. And of course,
[14:46] if you ever wonder where you can be able
[14:47] to get the API keys, you can navigate to
[14:49] your Stripe dashboard. And here there is
[14:51] a developer. So if you click on
[14:52] developer, there's API keys. And here
[14:54] you can see that we have our publishable
[14:56] keys and also secret keys. So we're
[14:57] going to need those tools inside of our
[14:59] MV.local file to call the right Stripe
[15:01] account to get a payment, right? So in
[15:03] this case, once you get your publish key
[15:05] and your secret key, you can literally
[15:07] add this in your file and then be able
[15:09] to use it eventually. Okay. So what
[15:10] we're going to do now is that I'm just
[15:11] going to come back to claw code. And
[15:13] here you can see this the entire plan
[15:14] for our bookkeeper pro application.
[15:16] Right? So here is the current stack the
[15:18] payment structure the plan for the
[15:20] management as well as the gating tier.
[15:22] So for example like the starter plan you
[15:24] get the unlimited receipt scanning.
[15:26] Great. The categorizations also the CSV
[15:28] export which is perfect. But what you
[15:31] don't get is you don't get the bank
[15:34] reconciliations the automated invoicing
[15:36] and also tax optimizations. Right? So
[15:38] you don't get those things for the
[15:39] starter plan but growth plan you do. Uh
[15:42] there's also the database setup. So for
[15:43] example, you can. So here you can see
[15:45] it's also going to set up the database
[15:46] table for the subscriptions and also
[15:48] subscription plan as well as the strike
[15:51] configurations, the backend API routes,
[15:54] endpoints as well as the front
[15:55] integrations, the web hooks. And if you
[15:57] were to scroll all the way down, you can
[15:59] see here that it's going to use the
[16:00] stripe integration scale to implement
[16:02] the checkout, the customer portal, the
[16:04] web hook handlers, the database schema
[16:06] for the subscription tracking, and also
[16:08] the future gating middleware. So this is
[16:10] not something that cloud code knows by
[16:12] itself. This is going to be something
[16:13] that it calls our skill that we created
[16:15] and we will implement this entirely.
[16:16] Okay. So in this case I'm just going to
[16:18] say yes and bypass all permission and
[16:20] it's going to design everything
[16:21] completely by itself. Okay. So in this
[16:24] case let's wait for a bit while it's
[16:25] doing that. Okay. So as result you can
[16:27] see the stripe integration here has
[16:29] fully complete. And now you can see that
[16:30] we have three tiers starter growth and
[16:32] also the protier. So now if I were to
[16:34] navigate to thev.example example file.
[16:36] Here you can see that we have five
[16:37] environment variables that's created for
[16:39] this application. So we have our publish
[16:41] key as well as the secret key, the web
[16:44] hook secret as well as the pricing ID
[16:46] for the growth and also the pro plan.
[16:48] Right? So you can see that we can simply
[16:49] just going to get these things um inside
[16:51] of our dashboard in our stripe. Then we
[16:54] can be able to add this in inside of
[16:55] ourv.local file and we can be able to
[16:57] use it. So in this case I'm just going
[16:58] to fill this in inside myv.loc local
[17:00] file and navigate it to our applications
[17:02] and try to log in and try to see if the
[17:04] payment gateway is fully set up. And now
[17:06] if I were to navigate to our application
[17:07] here, if I were to choose a plan, for
[17:09] example, I'm just going to choose the
[17:11] growth plan. If I were to click on start
[17:12] on this plan and here you can see that
[17:14] it navigate us to the checking page. And
[17:15] right here you can see that currently I
[17:17] create a sandbox environment so they can
[17:19] be able to process it using a test
[17:20] account. So right here you can see that
[17:22] we have our bookkeepers growth plan 7
[17:24] days free trial and after that it's
[17:25] going to be $19 per month starting
[17:27] January 3rd. And all I have to do here
[17:28] just simply just enter the card
[17:30] informations with the test card. And now
[17:31] if I were to click on start a free
[17:32] trial, it's going to process this. And
[17:34] now you can see that the test payment
[17:36] here has been successful. And if I were
[17:37] to click on the settings here and
[17:39] currently you can see that we're using
[17:40] the growth tier which is costing $19 per
[17:42] month. So pretty much that's how we can
[17:43] use the stripe integration clause skill
[17:45] to guide the AI here to basically build
[17:46] our payment system for our application.
[17:48] All right. So the last skill we're going
[17:49] to take a look at for this entire video
[17:51] here is going to be the skill creator.
[17:53] And this skill here help us to create
[17:54] claw skills for our entire projects. And
[17:56] to use this skill, basically we just
[17:58] provide instructions on what kind of
[18:00] skill we want to create. And it's going
[18:01] to trigger this skill creator to
[18:02] basically help us create a skill. And to
[18:04] do so, I basically have claw here do a
[18:07] research on exactly what's the best way
[18:09] to review code. Because for a day-to-day
[18:10] workflow, I have to review tons of code
[18:12] from different projects, right? And I
[18:13] have to give a lot of feedback to
[18:15] people. So that's why I want to create
[18:16] this skill that I can be able to
[18:17] delegate this work to AI that can have
[18:19] AI here to create a consistent feedback
[18:21] based on different projects that we
[18:22] encounter. So right here you can see
[18:23] that there are different things that
[18:24] we're going to have AI here to do deep
[18:26] research on what's the best way for
[18:27] technical review here. What's the best
[18:29] practice for especially for NestJ
[18:31] architecture patterns as well as React
[18:33] and TypeScript projects as well as
[18:35] what's the multi-perspect review, right?
[18:37] Especially for higher level like senior
[18:39] developers or staff engineers. You're
[18:41] not just reviewing just the technical
[18:42] side of things. You also have to review
[18:44] the system based on different roles. For
[18:45] example, like an architect, product
[18:47] manager, QA or user experience overall.
[18:50] try to evaluate the codebase to see if
[18:52] it actually solved that business
[18:53] problem, right? And also what is the
[18:55] code review methodologies, right? Make
[18:57] sure that if we want to use top- down
[18:58] approach, time allocation strategies,
[19:00] we're also doing the documentation
[19:01] review and also making sure that we
[19:03] stand on the product and the user
[19:05] experience perspective. Try to make sure
[19:07] that the product here is focusing on the
[19:09] customer first thinking, right? Making
[19:10] sure that customer is actually able to
[19:12] use this product and is able to solve
[19:13] the problem that they're facing and also
[19:15] what is the mobile experience look like?
[19:17] What is the usability, right? So
[19:18] basically it's going to do a deep
[19:19] research on this simply just going to
[19:21] use the deep research right here in the
[19:23] cloud and it'll basically automatically
[19:25] help you to look through like tons of
[19:26] resource. You can see that it's going to
[19:27] look through like 432 sources online and
[19:30] try to conduct this entire research and
[19:32] conclude it into a one single MD file.
[19:34] Right? And what I'm going to do now is
[19:35] I'm just going to open a cloud session.
[19:37] I'm just going to reference the research
[19:39] file which is the one that we just done
[19:40] for the research from Claude. And then
[19:42] I'm just going to say that please use
[19:44] the skill creator skill to basically
[19:47] create a skill based on this research
[19:48] that we have done. And then here's
[19:50] basically my prompt. So I'm just going
[19:52] to send this to Claude and let Claude
[19:54] here to basically handle this trigger
[19:56] the skill creator skill. And here you
[19:57] can see that's going to use the skill
[19:59] creator skill to basically build a
[20:00] comprehensive co-review skill based on
[20:02] the research document that we have
[20:04] provided. So right here you can see that
[20:05] it's triggering the skill creator
[20:06] reading the research.md file and
[20:08] eventually you can see that it creates
[20:09] the skill creator skill inside of our
[20:11] skills folder right here. So you can see
[20:13] that we have our skill MD file. We also
[20:15] have a couple references on the NJS
[20:17] patterns the perspective the report
[20:19] templates and all those kind of things.
[20:21] Okay. So what we can do now is that if
[20:23] we want to review this we can actually
[20:24] open this doc and here you can see that
[20:26] this is the NESJS code review skill and
[20:28] basically this is when to use the skill
[20:30] right. This is basically telling AI what
[20:32] are times when we're going to trigger
[20:33] the scale for example reviewing the NJS
[20:35] pull request or if there's code changes
[20:37] and also for the existing codebase for
[20:40] quality security and performance and
[20:42] then in terms of our review there's
[20:44] different phases we have architecture
[20:46] review so that's going to be the first
[20:47] step uh things like checking out the
[20:50] overall design identify if there's any
[20:52] blocking issues and then also there's
[20:54] the file structure review try to evalate
[20:56] the organizations the naming conventions
[20:58] and also the expected structure Um after
[21:00] that's done we also have our detailed
[21:02] component review. This is going to be
[21:03] more like reviewing line by line and try
[21:05] to stand on all six expert perspectives
[21:08] like senior developers, system
[21:09] architects. There's also PMs and also
[21:11] the user Q engineer and also the
[21:13] business analyst. Okay, so pretty much
[21:15] this is the phase three. And after all
[21:17] is done, we're going to create a
[21:18] documentation review and then at the end
[21:20] it's going to generate a review report
[21:22] that's very similar to like this where
[21:23] it's going to mention what are the
[21:24] findings, what are the issues that I
[21:26] found and whether or not this codebase
[21:27] or this pull request is approved. So
[21:29] pretty much you can see that this is the
[21:30] entire um skill that we have created and
[21:33] what I'm going to do here is I'm going
[21:35] to open a clause session and I'm just
[21:37] going to say using the NestJS code
[21:39] review skill and please help me to
[21:40] review the entire codebase for this
[21:42] application and basically this is my
[21:44] prompt and I'm just going to submit this
[21:45] to Claude and hopefully Claude will
[21:47] basically trigger the Nest.js code
[21:49] review scale which you can see is asking
[21:51] if you want to proceed with the NestJS
[21:53] code review scale. I'm just going to say
[21:55] yes and then it's going to bree through
[21:56] the entire NestJS code review skills and
[21:58] try to understand how it's going to
[22:00] review this uh four-phase methodologies.
[22:02] Right? So right here you can see it's
[22:04] going to be doing the phase one for
[22:05] architecture review. So in this case
[22:07] pretty much that's how we can be able to
[22:08] use the claw skill creator here to
[22:10] create a new skill instead of claude. So
[22:12] pretty much that's what we have covered
[22:13] in this video. We cover why we should
[22:15] use claw skills, what are three reasons,
[22:17] and how does it work behind the scenes,
[22:19] as well as my top four claw skills that
[22:21] you can use to boost your productivities
[22:23] using clot. So, pretty much that's it
[22:25] for this video. And if you do find out

[22:29] more content like this. But with that
