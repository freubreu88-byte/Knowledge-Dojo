# Generate Enhanced Video Metadata With An Llm

## 💡 Concept Definition
4

## 🎯 When to Use
- **Primary Use Case:** [Identify when this pattern is the most effective solution]
- **Constraints:** [When is this NOT the right tool?]

## 💻 Minimal Working Example
```prompt
I need to enhance the metadata for a YouTube video. The current title is 'Vibe Coding No Talking Stream #6'. It currently has no description and no tags.

Please generate:
1.  An improved, engaging description for this video. It should provide more context about what 'vibe coding' is, what viewers can expect (e.g., focus, atmosphere), and include relevant hashtags (as shown at 08:06).
2.  A list of 10-15 highly relevant tags for this video to improve its discoverability (as shown at 08:15).

Assume the video is a live coding session focused on productivity and a relaxed atmosphere, without commentary.
```

## ⚠️ Pitfalls & Gotchas

- Common pitfall 2

## 🛠️ Verification Protocol
**Goal:** Use an AI model to automatically enhance a video's description and generate relevant tags based on its title and context.

**Steps:**
1. Choose a short video or a video idea with a simple title (e.g., 'Vibe Coding No Talking Stream' as used at 07:32).
2. Identify the current (or hypothetical) minimal description and lack of tags.
3. Craft a prompt for a capable LLM (like Gemini 3 Pro) asking it to enhance the video's description and suggest a list of relevant tags.
4. Specify that the description should be more engaging, include hashtags, and provide more context about the video (as demonstrated at 08:03).
5. Review the generated description and tags for relevance, quality, and inclusion of requested elements.
