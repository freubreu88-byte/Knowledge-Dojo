# Configure Persistent Project Memory

## 💡 Concept Definition
- CLAUDE.md acts as a long-term memory and rule set for your project
- Claude automatically loads this configuration at the start of every session
- Rules can be added manually or by asking Claude to update its own memory

## 🎯 When to Use
- **Primary Use Case:** [Identify when this pattern is the most effective solution]
- **Constraints:** [When is this NOT the right tool?]

## 💻 Minimal Working Example
```code
# CLAUDE.md

## ⚠️ Pitfalls & Gotchas
- Common pitfall 1
- Common pitfall 2

## 🛠️ Verification Protocol
**Goal:** Create a CLAUDE.md file that enforces specific coding standards and project structure

**Steps:**
1. Create a file named 'CLAUDE.md' in your project root
2. Add a section for 'Coding Standards' (e.g., 'Use functional components', 'Prefer Tailwind for styling')
3. Launch Claude Code in the terminal
4. Ask Claude to generate a new component and observe if it follows the rules in CLAUDE.md
5. Prompt Claude to 'Add a rule to CLAUDE.md that all utility functions must have JSDoc' and verify the file update
