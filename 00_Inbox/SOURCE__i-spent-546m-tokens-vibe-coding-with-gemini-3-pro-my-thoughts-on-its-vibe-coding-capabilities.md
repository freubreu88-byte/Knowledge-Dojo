  title: I Spent 54.6M Tokens Vibe Coding With Gemini 3 Pro | My Thoughts On Its Vibe
    Coding Capabilities
  description: "I ran 54.6M tokens through Gemini 3 Pro in Cursor 2.0 to see how it\
    \ actually handles vibe coding on real production work. In this session I push ViewCreator\u2019\
    s UI toward a cleaner, responsive redesign, ship a few backend features (like \u201C\
    enhance with AI\u201D for YouTube titles/descriptions/tags), and compare speed,\
    \ cost, and reliability against my usual stack. If you care about practical vibe\
    \ coding performance, stable diffs, and where Gemini 3 Pro fits in a day-to-day\
    \ cursor workflow, this is a clear, candid review.\n\n\U0001F310 Links\nViewCreator\
