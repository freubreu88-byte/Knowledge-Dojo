[00:00] In this video, I'm going to be sharing
[00:02] 10 things that I've learned after over
[00:05] 100 days of vibe coding an app until I
[00:07] make a million dollars. For the past
[00:09] several months, I have been building in
[00:12] public vibe coding an app with the goal
[00:15] of making a million dollars. And I have
[00:16] to say, it's pretty cool to be able to
[00:18] reflect on this journey. You can see
[00:20] here, here's just the YouTube playlist.
[00:21] and to be able to scroll down here and
[00:24] see all of these streams and just the
[00:26] hours and hours and hours that have gone
[00:28] into building what we've built in the
[00:31] last 112 days. It really is incredible.
[00:33] And you can go back here and now see,
[00:35] you know, where this journey started.
[00:37] And in the last 112 days, we've been
[00:40] able to grow our community to 20,677
[00:44] subscribers. And the Bridgemind Discord
[00:47] community now has uh over 2,000 members.
[00:50] You know, our goals for 2026 were to hit
[00:52] 10,000 on YouTube and 1,000 in the
[00:56] Discord, and we more than doubled it on
[00:58] both platforms. So, shout out to you
[01:00] guys. Thank you for all the support. If
[01:02] you haven't already joined the
[01:03] Bridgemind community, this is now
[01:05] inherently the fastest growing vibe
[01:07] coding community on the internet. It's
[01:09] full of real builders that are on the
[01:11] cutting edge of the AI revolution
[01:13] adopting the most up-to-date workflows
[01:16] with agentic coding and with vibe coding
[01:19] which are interchangeable. But if you
[01:21] have not already joined this community,
[01:23] make sure you do so in 2026. We are
[01:25] going to be doing great things. Um this
[01:27] is going to be the place to be in 2026.
[01:30] And with that being said, I'm just going
[01:32] to ask you that you like this video,
[01:34] show your support for uh the journey so
[01:36] far. And um with that being said, let's
[01:38] get right into the video.
[01:43] Number 10 on this list is the idea of
[01:46] being able to adapt quickly. Um if we go
[01:50] back to day one, I just want to show you
[01:51] guys this real quick. Look at this. So
[01:54] here is the day one, right? And you can
[01:56] see down here that I was using cursor at
[01:58] the time. And I want to draw your
[02:00] attention right here. Uh you can see
[02:03] which tool I was using. I was using
[02:04] cursor and I was also using claude for
[02:08] sonnet. And it's incredible to be able
[02:10] to look back at this because in this
[02:12] time period the amount of tools and
[02:15] models that have actually been released
[02:17] in the past 112 days is remarkable. Uh I
[02:20] was using claw for sonnet max inside of
[02:23] cursor at the very start of this
[02:24] journey. But in the the process of this
[02:27] journey, we were receiving GPT5 GBT5
[02:30] codecs. Codecex came out and our
[02:33] workflow adapted over this period. You
[02:36] know, I can go to like let's go out here
[02:38] and let's go back to let's say um I can
[02:41] probably just choose look look at this.
[02:43] You can see that you know I moved from
[02:44] cursor you was using cursor with cloud
[02:47] for sonnet to using um I totally
[02:50] transitioned to let's like see if I can
[02:51] go to the start here and find what I was
[02:53] using on this day. Um I know that I was
[02:55] using uh codec at the time but look at
[02:58] this. So you can see here that now you
[03:00] can see that hey I switched from using
[03:02] cursor with claude for sonnet max to a
[03:05] complete GPT5 codeex workflow where I
[03:08] started launching multiple agents at the
[03:11] same time. And you can see that here my
[03:14] workflow adapted based on both the
[03:18] models that were the best at the time as
[03:21] well as the end tools that we were
[03:23] using. Right? because uh when Codeex
[03:25] came out, especially GBT5 codecs, it was
[03:28] a very good tool and it was probably the
[03:30] best tool at the time. But now things
[03:33] have even evolved since then and I've
[03:35] had to adapt again. And if we go to any
[03:37] of my re most recent streams, I'm using
[03:39] a completely different workflow. If we
[03:41] go back here, you can see that I'm using
[03:43] all Claude code agents inside of Warp to
[03:46] be able to manage agentic panes and I'm
[03:49] using Claude Opus 4.5. Now I still am
[03:52] using cursor but for different purposes.
[03:54] I'm using it for like the end you know
[03:57] the browser tool or uh Gemini 3 pro
[03:59] access different things like that. But
[04:01] my point with this is that something
[04:02] that I've learned number 10 is that you
[04:04] have to be able to adapt because this
[04:06] this field is moving incredibly quickly
[04:10] and you can't like stick with one
[04:12] specific workflow. You have to be
[04:14] involved in a community and you have to
[04:16] learn what other people are doing and
[04:18] what's working for other people and try
[04:20] to figure out how you can adapt that to
[04:22] your workflow or how you can build new
[04:24] workflows that work for you. And that is
[04:27] definitely a huge thing that I've
[04:29] learned that you have to adapt quickly.
[04:35] Number nine on the list of things that
[04:38] I've learned is this idea that there is
[04:40] not a single right way of doing
[04:43] something right. There is a whole range
[04:47] of different workflows. There's a whole
[04:49] different range of processes. And I
[04:52] think that what we're seeing in this
[04:53] series is that hey, you just have to be
[04:56] able to adapt quickly and you have to be
[04:58] open to changing your workflow and not
[05:01] getting glued to, let's say, what people
[05:03] are saying on the internet because there
[05:05] is no right way. There's not one
[05:07] singular right tool. There is so many
[05:10] competitors in the vibe coding, agentic
[05:13] coding space and there's not a singular
[05:16] correct tool that you should be using.
[05:18] For example, let's take anti-gravity,
[05:21] right? Anti-gravity is Google's IDE and
[05:23] right now they are offering free a AI
[05:26] use right that you can use it for free
[05:28] in different areas. It does have limits
[05:29] but you know a lot of people are using
[05:31] that tool because it's right for them
[05:34] and their budget right so it makes sense
[05:36] now for me I use claude code with the
[05:39] max 20x plan and I use uh GBD5 pro or
[05:43] chat GBT pro and I use cursor ultra and
[05:47] my point with that is that you have to
[05:49] figure out what works for you in this
[05:51] space and you can't get distracted by
[05:54] for example what other people are doing
[05:56] now you have to pay attention to what
[05:58] other people are doing, but you can't
[06:00] just say, "Oh, because this person is
[06:01] doing it this way, this is the right
[06:03] way." There's a right way for you in
[06:06] whatever situation you're in and what
[06:08] project you're working on, right? So,
[06:10] for example, hey, if I'm using uh an
[06:12] agent to be able to build some UI, in a
[06:14] lot of instances, it's smart to use
[06:16] Gemini 3 Pro because Gemini 3 Pro is
[06:18] good at UI. But you know you would also
[06:22] have an argument that hey Claude Opus
[06:24] 4.5 with the front-end design skill is
[06:26] better in some instances right so my
[06:29] point is that there is not a singular
[06:31] right way to be doing something you just
[06:33] have to figure out the ways that and the
[06:36] strategies that work for you personally
[06:38] and your workflow and your project. So,
[06:41] that's definitely something that I've
[06:42] learned and um that's been able to open
[06:45] me up to different workflows because it
[06:47] makes it so that I don't get glued to
[06:49] the workflow that I'm using and that I'm
[06:51] a little bit more open to uh what other
[06:54] people are doing because there's not one
[06:56] right way. There's a ton of different
[06:57] workflows. There's a ton of different
[06:59] ways that you can be doing this and it's
[07:01] very important that you're open to
[07:03] different workflows and adopting new
[07:05] ways of doing things.
[07:10] Number eight is this fact that building
[07:14] is the best way to learn. And I want to
[07:18] show you guys my GitHub and just share
[07:20] with you the amount of contributions
[07:22] that I've made in the last year and
[07:25] highlight the amount of contributions
[07:26] that I've made in the last couple of
[07:28] months while I've been on this journey.
[07:29] So you can see, hey, this journey has
[07:31] basically stemmed from, you know, August
[07:33] to December. And you can see that I have
[07:35] basically been operating at about
[07:37] probably around a 95% hit rate in terms
[07:39] of days programmed. And what you have to
[07:43] do is you it everything is changing with
[07:46] AI. And what's changing is that instead
[07:48] of having to like go get a CS degree to
[07:52] understand how to program, now let's say
[07:55] that you have an idea. Now you can just
[07:57] start building your idea immediately and
[08:00] AI is able to fill in a lot of the gaps
[08:02] that you may not understand. Now what is
[08:04] important is that as you're going along
[08:07] while you're building that you are
[08:09] actually asking AI the questions that
[08:11] you need to understand um in order to be
[08:14] able to manage and learn with while
[08:16] you're building right so you need to
[08:18] understand for example I'll use one
[08:19] example you know yesterday I was
[08:20] building the view creator MCP and I had
[08:22] never built an MCP before right but I
[08:25] knew that hey if I just actually work on
[08:27] building this and I learn along the way
[08:29] I'll learn how to build an MCP and I'll
[08:31] actually get it done right and we were
[08:33] able to get a view cur MCP built and
[08:35] deployed yesterday in under six hours.
[08:38] And the point that I'm making here is
[08:40] that a lot of people have this idea that
[08:43] in order to be able to um you know do
[08:45] something that you have to have a a
[08:48] degree or you have to have
[08:49] certifications. That is not the case
[08:51] anymore. With AI, you can just
[08:53] immediately start building and as you're
[08:56] going along, you can be learning from
[08:58] the AI as the AI is building the system
[09:01] so that you can then put the guard rails
[09:02] in place and so that you have the
[09:04] understanding so that you have the
[09:06] ability to orchestrate the agents
[09:08] correctly. So the best way to learn now
[09:10] in 2025 and heading into 2026 is by
[09:14] building. And that's one incredibly
[09:16] important thing that I've learned in
[09:18] this journey so far.
[09:23] Another thing that I've learned in this
[09:24] journey is that progress is exponential.
[09:27] You know, I think whenever people are
[09:29] starting on something new, whether it's
[09:31] a business or it's a project or they're
[09:34] just trying to learn, you know, you you
[09:36] start very early on and like I'll just
[09:38] draw a chart here, right? It's like,
[09:40] hey, let's say that you start, you know,
[09:41] this is day one and this is day 100. You
[09:45] know, a lot of people don't understand
[09:47] that they come into something and they
[09:49] expect that, hey, at the start I'm just
[09:50] going to be making a ton of progress and
[09:52] it's going to look like this, right?
[09:53] It's not the case. Um, what I've learned
[09:56] from this journey, and this goes for a
[09:57] variety of different things, right? This
[09:58] goes for the growth of the bridge mind
[10:01] community. This goes for the growth of
[10:03] your revenue trajectory. This goes for
[10:05] the your understanding personally, let's
[10:07] say, of your skills and your ability to
[10:10] build. And I think what it actually
[10:13] looks like is it's exponential. You
[10:14] know, you start something and it's like
[10:16] this and it can then go like this. And I
[10:19] think that what people what people lose
[10:21] sight of is because they were
[10:22] anticipating it to go like this, they
[10:25] end up quitting because it's very
[10:27] difficult in this early stage because
[10:29] you're expecting to be here, but in
[10:31] reality you're here, right? So there's a
[10:34] misunderstanding that hey you know
[10:36] people get into something and they
[10:38] realize like let's say you know a month
[10:40] into something like wow this is harder
[10:41] than I anticipated or harder than I
[10:43] expected and then they just quit and
[10:45] they give up because they don't truly
[10:47] understand the fact that progress is
[10:49] exponential. And when I say progress
[10:51] again I mean progress in a whole variety
[10:53] of different subjects. your abilities,
[10:56] your skills, um the growth of your
[10:58] revenue, the growth of your um product
[11:00] as a whole, your user base, your
[11:02] community, all these things. It's all
[11:04] exponential. And that's why on this
[11:06] channel and in this community, I talk so
[11:08] much about just showing up every day and
[11:10] giving it your all. Because if you do
[11:12] that, that's how you make progress. And
[11:15] that progress is exponential. And that's
[11:17] what I've discovered in this journey is
[11:19] that I remember, you know, when I first
[11:20] started how hard it was to do X, right?
[11:23] And now I'll just be just doing like 10x
[11:26] what I was accomplishing at the start of
[11:28] this journey because it's all
[11:30] exponential. Now if you go back to the
[11:32] start of this journey, you know, it's
[11:34] like you can even see for example like
[11:36] hey the GitHub contributions, you can
[11:39] see the growth of the channel. You can
[11:41] see the um you know go back to day one.
[11:43] You can see like the progress of hey it
[11:46] was harder early on to stream for
[11:49] multiple hours in a row, right? You can
[11:51] see all the streams were very very low
[11:53] in their length and you can see that
[11:55] they didn't get many views and you can
[11:56] see that there was no revenue and at
[11:58] some point you start to hit a threshold
[12:01] where you're like okay I can stream for
[12:03] longer now I can work for longer um I
[12:05] can build more in less time um I can
[12:08] build the revenue faster I now have you
[12:10] know all these things start compounding
[12:12] and compounding and compounding and it
[12:15] comes from you just showing up every
[12:16] single day and giving it your absolute
[12:18] best giving it your all and that's One
[12:21] thing that I've learned on this journey
[12:22] that I wanted to share with you is that
[12:24] progress is exponential.
[12:30] Another thing that I've learned in this
[12:31] journey is the fact that AI models are
[12:34] going to continue to get significantly
[12:37] better. And here's what I'm going to
[12:39] share with you. So, at the start of this
[12:40] journey, you know, you can look at this
[12:42] here and you can see uh I I basically
[12:45] listed the top frontier models. And you
[12:47] can see Gemini 3 Pro versus Gemini 2.5
[12:51] Pro 49 versus 62 Claude Forsonnet if you
[12:54] remember that was the first on day one
[12:56] that's what we were using look at how
[12:57] this was doing in the coding index on
[12:59] artificial analysis it was ranking at 45
[13:01] and now it's at 60 and I think to put
[13:04] this into perspective that in the last
[13:07] 112 days that we've been doing this um
[13:10] the AI models the fundamental driving
[13:12] force behind all the progress of what
[13:15] we've been building has lit literally
[13:17] increased by x amount, right? And these
[13:21] AI models are going to get significantly
[13:24] better. And what you guys need to
[13:25] realize is that with the underlying
[13:28] understanding that these are going to
[13:31] get better. The skill that you need to
[13:34] learn is how to learn and use AI agents
[13:38] and to be able to understand not how to
[13:40] use chat GPT but how to truly
[13:43] orchestrate agents to do your work for
[13:46] you in a way that will build and
[13:48] accomplish your dreams and goals. And
[13:51] you can see here like look at this. I
[13:53] mean you're looking at a significant
[13:55] improvement in just a couple of months.
[13:56] And we can even go to open router too.
[13:58] And one thing I want to show you, and I
[14:00] talk about this often, but we can go to
[14:01] Opus 4.5 here. And this model, which was
[14:04] a significant improvement versus the
[14:07] Claude Opus 4.1 model, look at the price
[14:10] drop. It It was a what, a 1/5if or
[14:13] one-third decrease in cost um from Opus
[14:16] 4.5 to Opus 4.1. I want to pull up um
[14:19] another Hold on. Let's um let's pull
[14:21] this up real quick. I'm going to pull up
[14:22] Open Router and we're going to actually
[14:24] look at that uh Opus 4.1 model as well.
[14:27] also opus 4.1 and what you guys are
[14:29] going to see here is yeah it's the so
[14:31] opus 4.1 was the old kind of like highly
[14:35] intelligent claude opus model and you
[14:37] can even see now how slow this model is
[14:39] it's literally 13 tokens per second 24
[14:41] tokens per second and it was $15 and $75
[14:44] respectively and now it's $5 and $25 so
[14:48] the AI models are getting smarter faster
[14:52] and cheaper and if you don't see this if
[14:55] you haven't been involved in this space.
[14:57] I don't know what to tell you. If you
[14:59] think that AI is a bubble, if you think
[15:01] it's hyped up, I think that you're
[15:03] wrong. Um, and I think that you're wrong
[15:05] because even in the past 112 days, the
[15:08] growth trajectory [clears throat]
[15:09] and the improvement of the intelligence
[15:11] of these models, of the speed, of the
[15:14] cost of the end tools that are actually
[15:16] implementing them, right? They've gotten
[15:19] significantly better. And one thing that
[15:21] I've learned is that I do not expect
[15:24] this to slow down. Um, if anything, I
[15:26] actually expect the growth rate in 2026
[15:29] to increase. And I expect that now in
[15:33] the future, we'll look at Opus 4.5 and
[15:36] we'll laugh at it. We'll look at it as
[15:37] it will become a legacy model very, very
[15:40] quickly. And that's one incredibly
[15:42] important thing that I've learned and
[15:44] now understand is that these models are
[15:46] not going to stop getting better anytime
[15:48] soon. And if you understand these
[15:50] agentic workflows, if you understand how
[15:52] to utilize AI to do your bidding, you
[15:55] are going to be incredibly successful.
[15:58] So that is definitely one thing I've
[16:00] learned is that these AI models are
[16:03] going to get incredibly better.
[16:09] Another thing that I've learned in this
[16:11] journey so far is the fact that
[16:13] community is important. And something I
[16:15] want to draw your attention to is that
[16:18] the Bridgemind Discord community is now
[16:20] up to over 2,200 members. You can see
[16:23] 2,232 here. And something I want to
[16:26] touch on is the fact that I have learned
[16:29] more from the Bridgemind community and
[16:31] the people that are in this community
[16:34] who are incredibly intelligent and on
[16:36] the cutting edge of the AI revolution
[16:38] than you guys have learned from me. And
[16:41] I I think that a lot of people they get
[16:42] this incorrect. you know, they approach
[16:44] this and they say, "Hey, I'm the I'm the
[16:46] teacher and I'm teaching all of you um
[16:48] how I do vibe coding and how I do
[16:50] agentic coding." But the reason that I
[16:52] started BridgeMind in large part is to
[16:55] build a community and to build a
[16:57] community that's not centered around me,
[17:00] but that is centered around being a part
[17:03] of the AI revolution and truly being on
[17:06] the cutting edge of this technological
[17:08] revolution and building the future
[17:10] together. And this community has
[17:13] completely changed my perspective. And
[17:15] if I didn't have this community, I would
[17:18] not be in the place that I am today
[17:20] because the workflow that I use now is
[17:22] in large part has been taught to me by
[17:25] many people from the bridge community.
[17:28] So for example, you know, I have
[17:29] conversations every day with people from
[17:31] the bridge community and I've learned
[17:34] for example, warp was suggested to me by
[17:36] W. Dan and um the multi- aent workflow
[17:40] that I use where I'm basically able to
[17:42] take one cloud code instance and pass it
[17:44] off to 10 codebase analyst agents and
[17:47] then pass those off to three agent B
[17:49] coder agents inside of one conversation.
[17:51] I learned that from super combo gamer.
[17:53] So it's like I'm just like I have met
[17:55] people in this community that have
[17:57] genuinely helped me and helped me become
[18:00] a better agentic coder or a vibe coder
[18:03] and that's incredibly important. I would
[18:05] not be in the same position that I am
[18:07] now if I did not have the bridge mind
[18:10] community. And that is incredibly
[18:12] important because if you're just in like
[18:14] a a black box and you're not paying
[18:16] attention to what other people are
[18:18] doing, if you're just focused on what
[18:19] you're doing, which is good in some
[18:21] situations, but not in this revolution
[18:24] because things are changing rapidly
[18:26] every single day. And I'm not kidding.
[18:29] being a part of the bridge mind
[18:30] community, you know, within 10 seconds
[18:32] if a new model just dropped from
[18:34] anthropic and we're already implementing
[18:36] and testing it. And I don't think that
[18:38] there's any other vibe coding community
[18:39] on the internet that is doing that. And
[18:42] that is one thing that I've learned that
[18:43] community is incredibly important,
[18:46] especially in this field. And I am so
[18:49] thankful for the bridge mind community.
[18:50] So definitely a very very important
[18:52] factor of this journey so far that I've
[18:54] learned.
[18:56] Another
[19:07] thing that I've learned in this journey
[19:09] so far is the fact that success is just
[19:12] an equation. And to me, success is times
[19:17] effort to the power of consistency. And
[19:20] I see success as this equation because I
[19:23] think people they look at success and
[19:24] they ask okay well what is success
[19:26] right? Success can take the can success
[19:29] can take the form of a multitude of
[19:31] different things. Some people think that
[19:32] success is money. Some people think that
[19:34] success is freedom. Some people think
[19:36] success is fame. Some people think
[19:38] success is xyz. You name it having a you
[19:40] know all these things that people think
[19:41] success is. But what I've learned in
[19:43] this journey and what I believe in is
[19:45] that I think that success can be broken
[19:47] down is simply as an equation that if
[19:50] you follow it uh you will achieve
[19:54] success. And again success to me is time
[19:57] times effort to the power of consistency
[20:00] because if you're putting in the time if
[20:02] you're putting in the effort and if
[20:04] you're consistent you will be successful
[20:06] in whatever you're doing. And I think
[20:08] that it may end up looking different,
[20:10] right? You could have a goal and a
[20:12] mission and it could end up taking a
[20:13] completely different form. But if you
[20:15] are showing up and you're putting in the
[20:17] time, you're putting in the effort and
[20:19] putting in the consistency, those are
[20:21] the only three things that you need to
[20:23] worry about and everything else is going
[20:24] to take care of itself. So just focus on
[20:27] those three things and I do think that
[20:29] you will be successful. That's one
[20:31] incredibly important thing that I've
[20:33] learned.
[20:37] Another thing that I've learned while on
[20:39] this journey is that opportunities are
[20:41] revealed while you're in the arena. Now,
[20:44] if you guys are familiar, you know, I've
[20:45] had this up on my wall since um since
[20:48] pretty much the very I've had this up on
[20:50] my wall since I was a teenager, and I've
[20:52] always put it in whatever office I was
[20:54] working in. And uh you guys have seen it
[20:56] up here now for a long time. And I
[20:58] believe that here's the man in the
[21:00] arena. If you're unfamiliar with this,
[21:02] it's a quote from Theodore Roosevelt.
[21:04] And um basically it says it is not the
[21:06] critic who counts, not the man who
[21:08] points out how the strong man stumbles
[21:09] or where the doer of deeds could have
[21:11] done them better. The credit belongs to
[21:13] the man who is actually in the arena
[21:15] whose face is marred by dust and sweat
[21:17] and blood. Who strives valiantly, who
[21:19] errors, who comes short again and again
[21:22] because there is no effort without error
[21:24] and shortcoming. But who he but he who
[21:27] does actually strive to do the deeds,
[21:28] who knows great enthusiasms, the great
[21:31] devotions, who spends himself in a
[21:33] worthy cause, who at the best knows in
[21:35] the end the triumph of high achievement,
[21:37] and who at the worst if he fails, at
[21:39] least he fails while daring greatly, so
[21:41] that his place shall never be with those
[21:43] cold and timid souls who neither know
[21:46] victory nor defeat. And the reason that
[21:48] I talk about this speech and why I have
[21:50] it up on the wall is because
[21:52] opportunities are revealed in the arena.
[21:55] And you could go into something with one
[21:57] perspective and one understanding of the
[21:59] mission or the goal that you have and it
[22:01] could take on a completely different
[22:03] form because of the opportunities that
[22:05] reveal themselves in the arena. So, in
[22:08] my opinion, it is better for you to dare
[22:11] greatly and to take risks and to give it
[22:14] your all and to be in the arena rather
[22:16] than being one of those cold and timid
[22:19] souls who never know victory or defeat.
[22:22] Because what I found on this journey so
[22:24] far is that you may start something in
[22:26] one direction and end up going in a
[22:28] completely different direction. And the
[22:29] reason is not because uh you decided to
[22:32] give up and fail. Rather, you saw
[22:35] opportunities that were revealed to you
[22:37] while you were daring greatly and while
[22:39] you were in the arena. And that is one
[22:41] incredibly important thing that I've
[22:43] learned in this journey.
[22:48] The final and most important thing that
[22:50] I've learned on this journey so far is
[22:53] that agentic coding is the future. And I
[22:57] think that when we first started out,
[22:59] you know, I would get so much hate about
[23:02] vibe coding and vibe coding and agent
[23:04] coding are completely interchangeable.
[23:06] Uh I think that if there's anything that
[23:08] I've learned on this journey so far, the
[23:10] number one thing is that this is the
[23:12] future of software development. Uh,
[23:14] Agentic coding is the future and it has
[23:18] been proven along this journey because
[23:20] we have built a very large robust
[23:23] production application with over 2,000
[23:26] users in just a couple of months time
[23:30] and we did it with a singular small team
[23:34] and we did it incredibly quickly. I did
[23:36] things that I never knew that I could do
[23:38] before. And if you look at the evolution
[23:42] of this journey so far and you go back
[23:44] and you look through how vibe coding or
[23:47] agentic coding has evolved even from the
[23:49] start of this journey, you can see that
[23:53] this is obviously the future of software
[23:54] development. And I don't know what
[23:56] exactly it will look like five years
[23:59] from now, but I would be very surprised
[24:01] if people are writing any code at all.
[24:03] It is all going to be through agentic
[24:05] systems and I believe now that agentic
[24:08] coding is the future and if we take a
[24:11] look at you know for example my existing
[24:14] workflow it's completely evolved and the
[24:17] AI tools that I'm using have completely
[24:19] evolved and for example like now hey you
[24:20] have tools like warp where hey I can
[24:22] just go here I can launch a bunch of
[24:24] panes and just like this in under like
[24:27] 20 seconds I now have I'm just going to
[24:29] launch claude claude claude here watch
[24:30] this so claude claude Claude Claude and
[24:34] these agents are all now ready to do my
[24:37] work for me and I'm they're ready to
[24:38] take tasks and this has evolved. I mean
[24:42] when we first started we were just
[24:43] working in um I mean this when I when we
[24:46] first started this journey I've been
[24:47] doing vibe coding and agentic coding for
[24:51] three years now since chat GBT released
[24:53] and it's evolved so quickly into the
[24:56] point where it's become so powerful that
[24:59] it's obvious that this is the future of
[25:01] software development and there are still
[25:04] going to be people that disagree with
[25:05] this and there are going to be people
[25:06] that bring up the points of hey it still
[25:09] has issues here here and here but The
[25:11] thing is is that we cannot doubt this
[25:15] technological revolution and we cannot
[25:18] bet against it. I would not bet against
[25:20] it. I am all in on agentic coding and
[25:24] vibe coding and I think that agentic
[25:27] coding is the future of software
[25:28] development and if you're not seeing
[25:30] that I would suggest that you start to
[25:32] look deeper into it and look at what
[25:34] we've accomplished with this journey so
[25:36] far and that you keep up to date with
[25:39] what we're doing at Bridgemind because
[25:40] we are going to build uh different
[25:43] projects and things in 2026 that I think
[25:45] are going to shock the world and to
[25:47] truly prove the capabilities of a
[25:50] authentic coding or vibe coding which
[25:52] it's commonly referred to as but I
[25:55] expect that this technology and these
[25:57] tools and workflows are going to
[26:00] continue to improve and a year from now
[26:03] we are going to be working with
[26:05] completely different systems because if
[26:07] you rewind the clock back to the start
[26:09] of 2025 you know we didn't even have
[26:12] some of the tools that we now use in our
[26:14] everyday workflows and I expect this to
[26:17] continue I expect that the people that
[26:20] are going to be uh rewarded for this
[26:23] technological revolution are the ones
[26:25] that are involved now while it's still
[26:27] early because if you don't understand
[26:30] these workflows, if you don't understand
[26:32] the skill of agent orchestration, you
[26:34] will be left behind. And I'm not saying
[26:36] that to um you know uh get you worried.
[26:39] I'm just saying that if you have not yet
[26:41] adopted agentic coding, I highly
[26:44] recommend that you start working with
[26:46] these tools and start learning these
[26:48] workflows because there is a skill to it
[26:50] and um I believe that agentic coding is
[26:53] the future. With that being said, make
