  title: 10 Things I Learned After 112 Days Of Vibe Coding An App Until I Make $1,000,000
  description: "I have been vibe coding an app every single day for the last 112 days\
    \ with the goal of making $1,000,000. In that time, we built ViewCreator\u2014a\
    \ production AI platform for creators and teams\u2014from line zero to a soft launch\
    \ with over 2,000 users and $2,500+ in revenue.\n\nThis journey wasn't just about\
    \ the code; it was about the fundamental shift in how software is built. In this\
    \ video, I break down the 10 Critical Lessons I've learned from over 500 hours of\
    \ agentic coding. We discuss why ViewCreator succeeded where others failed, why\
    \ I am betting the house that Agentic Coding is the Future, and how to adapt your\
    \ workflow when tools like Claude Opus 4.5, Gemini 3 Flash, and Warp are constantly\
    \ changing the meta.\n\nThe Top 10 Things:\n\nAgentic Coding Is The Future: Why\
    \ manual coding is dying and orchestration is the new superpower.\n\nOpportunities\
    \ Are Revealed In The Arena: You can't strategize from the sidelines; building ViewCreator\
    \ revealed paths I never saw coming.\n\nSuccess Is An Equation: Time x Effort ^\
    \ Consistency.\n\nOptimism Is An Asset (Exclusive to Discord): This point was too\
    \ hot for YouTube. Join the Discord to read why believing in the outcome is a competitive\
    \ advantage: https://bridgemind.ai/discord\n\nCommunity Is Important: How the BridgeMind\
    \ collective (shoutout WDan and Super Combo) accelerated my learning curve.\n\n\
    AI Models Will Get Significantly Better: We are on an exponential curve; betting\
    \ against the tech is a losing strategy.\n\nProgress Is Exponential: The \"hockey\
    \ stick\" growth applies to your skills and revenue, not just the AI models.\n\n\
    Building Is The Best Way To Learn: Stop watching tutorials. Start shipping.\n\n\
    There Is Not One \"Right Way\": Why dogmatism kills progress and why your stack\
    \ must be fluid.\n\nAdapt Quickly: How I switched from Claude 3.5 Sonnet to GPT-5\
    \ Codex to Claude Opus 4.5 without missing a beat.\n\n\U0001F310 Links\n\nViewCreator\
